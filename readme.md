# Cache

KanColle gadget server cache.

This cache can be used to bypass the gadget server block, as a CDN (GitHub [pages](https://kcwiki.github.io/cache/gadget_html5/js/kcs_const.js)/Fastly) by the [DMM extension](https://github.com/kcwiki/chrome-extension-dmm), [Redirector extension](https://github.com/einaregilsson/Redirector) (by importing [`redirector.json`](https://github.com/kcwiki/cache/blob/master/redirector.json)), [KC3Kai extension](https://github.com/KC3Kai/KC3Kai) (by enabling it as a gadget cache in settings), or locally as [Poi](https://github.com/poooi/poi) [third party cache](https://github.com/kcwiki/cache/releases).
